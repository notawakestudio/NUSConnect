# NUS Connect (Orbital Project AY20/21)
A gamified learning management system that is accessible to all and easy to use.

## Level of Achievement
Officially: **Artemis**

In our own words:

A software application that we are proud of. One that follows the standard software engineering practices. One that we are not afraid to show you the code. One that we use to remember this summer of NUS CS journey.
