## **Introduction**

Frustrated with the lack of material and information available from previous sem’s and the lack of functionality in the official learning management system LumiNUS, we set out to design a system where students can learn their module content in a more engaging way.

With our background as teaching assistants for the module CS2030(Programming methodology II), we have a burning desire to help our students strive for perfection. We know that learning takes time and continuous effort, but making the process of learning fun and enjoyable will greatly improve students’ performance. 

We hope that our project becomes a source of external motivating factors that nudge students to learn the materials by heart. We want students to feel good doing assignments, and be rewarded with virtual points and record their attempts for further analysis. We also want students to try alternative ways of learning, via questions and answers in a forum, via quizzes that are self generated or created by the TAs, and via consolidating their learning into articles to be shared with other module students in the wiki.

## **Quickstart**

## **Pages and Functionalities**
While our dream is to make learning fun for every student regardless of module, we hope to first create a pilot platform where targeted students studying CS2030/S will have the best learning experience in their life.

We want students to know the various ways of learning on top of doing school assignments (by actively raising questions and answering them, by attempting quizzes and creating quizzes themselves, and by summarizing what they learn in articles or diagrams to teach to others). 

Lastly we want all their learning activities to be tracked and gamified to provide a constant stream of motivation to achieve more. In summary, we hope to provide students with the following:

### Motivation
Gamification of tasks and visualization of student’s progress

### Learning opportunities
Forum - A forum for students to interact with one another, with live chatting, upvoting, and many other features.
Wiki - Knowledge database for students to see a collection of articles and diagrams that aid in explaining concepts taught in class
Quiz - Students and TAs can post their own quizzes and look back on past quizzes

### Convenience 
Weekly progress  - Once the week is over, the previous week’s level and progress will become final (cannot be changed). Allowing the student to view the progress they have made in each individual week of the semester. 
Be the goto place for students when they need information or want to do anything related to the module.

Finally, our final goal is to branch this out to every CS module and then to every NUS module and become the “forum” for NUS where everyone can come to view content and interact with peers taking the same mod. We hope to start small but grow big as we implement more features and make taking a new mod become a better experience.
